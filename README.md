# Covid19_analysis_Project
Project Name: COVID-19 Data Analysis

Summary:
This project examines COVID-19 data to uncover trends and impacts, utilizing data science methods taught in a Udemy course. It follows the CRISP-DM framework for hands-on data analysis.

Goals:

Collect and clean COVID-19 data.
Identify trends and insights.
Develop visualizations.
Use machine learning to make predictions.
Create dynamic dashboards.
Methodology:

Understanding the Business Context:
Analyze COVID-19 data to inform public health strategies.

Data Collection:
Data was gathered via REST APIs, including daily case counts, vaccination data, and demographic information.

Data Cleaning:
Using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library, the data was cleaned by:

Addressing missing data.
Normalizing values for comparison.
Parsing date columns for time series analysis.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations to identify patterns.
Built dynamic dashboards using Plotly and Dash to visualize daily case numbers, cumulative totals, and vaccination progress.
Machine Learning Techniques:

Linear regression to explore relationships between variables.
Exponential modeling to forecast future cases.
Time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet.
Conclusion:
This project successfully applied data science techniques to analyze COVID-19 data, yielding useful insights and an interactive dashboard for tracking the pandemic.
